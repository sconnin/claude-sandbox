# 4451-Rag-Demos

Monorepo for a series of RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) projects that
build sequentially on one another. Each project reuses and extends a shared
core engine rather than re-implementing chunking, ingestion, and retrieval
from scratch.

## How a query flows through the system

```
                       INGEST (offline, run once per chunking strategy)
.txt files  --[chunk]-->  chunks + metadata  --[embed + upsert]-->  Chroma collection
                                                                (documents_fixed /
                                                                 documents_structured)

                       QUERY (run per question)
user question
     |
     v
[decompose]  -->  sub-questions (2-4, each independently answerable)
     |
     v
[retrieve]   -->  per sub-question: nearest-neighbor semantic search against
     |             the chosen Chroma collection (no keyword/lexical matching)
     v
[synthesize] -->  final answer, citing source + chunk/section for each claim
```

`core/pipeline.py:run()` wires the query-side three steps together;
`core/ingestion.py:ingest()` is the offline ingest step. See
[`core/`](core) module docstrings for what each stage does.

## Conventions

- **Docstrings:** every `core/` module has a one-line docstring stating its
  purpose. A module gets a longer docstring only when a design choice needs
  justifying to a reader who didn't make it — e.g. `structured_chunking.py`
  explains *why* it splits on section/clause boundaries instead of fixed
  width, because that choice isn't obvious from the code alone.
- **Naming:** `fixed` / `structured` name chunking *strategies*;
  `documents_fixed` / `documents_structured` name the Chroma *collections*
  each strategy writes to. They're related but not the same kind of thing —
  see [`core/config.py:collection_name()`](core/config.py).

## Versioning convention

- **`core/`** holds logic that is genuinely shared and stable across projects
  (chunking strategies, the Chroma store wrapper, retrieval, synthesis). It
  has no CLI of its own — it's a library, not an entrypoint.
- **`projects/vN-<name>/`** holds one versioned project: its CLI
  entrypoints, and a README describing what it adds relative to the
  previous version. Projects import from `core` rather than duplicating it.
- A new project starts as `projects/v{N+1}-<name>/` and either reuses
  `core` unchanged or extends it (new module in `core/`, or a new function/
  parameter on an existing one) if the new project needs shared capability
  the previous ones didn't. Breaking changes to `core` should be avoided
  once more than one project depends on it — prefer additive changes
  (new optional params, new modules) so older projects keep working.
- Projects do not depend on each other directly, only on `core`.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .        # makes `core` importable from any project directory
```

Authenticate with OpenAI by setting `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` (already
gitignored), or via `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...`.

## Projects

- [`projects/v1-agentic-rag/`](projects/v1-agentic-rag/README.md) — query
  decomposition + Chroma retrieval + synthesis, with baseline (`fixed`) and
  section/clause-aware (`structured`) chunking strategies, each ingested
  into its own Chroma collection.

Run all project CLIs from the repo root (see each project's README for
exact commands), so relative paths like `./data` and `./chroma_db` resolve
consistently.
