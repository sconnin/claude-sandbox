# v1 — Agentic RAG (query decomposition + Chroma)

A basic agentic RAG pipeline: an OpenAI model (`gpt-5-mini`) decomposes a
complex question into sub-questions, each sub-question retrieves context
from a local Chroma collection, and the model synthesizes a final answer
from the combined context.

Built on the shared engine in [`core/`](../../core) — see the repo root
[README](../../README.md) for the overall monorepo structure and setup.

## Why query decomposition?

A single complex question (e.g. "Can OpenAI share my data with third
parties, and can I delete my account?") is really two separable questions.
Embedding the whole question as one query blurs its vector between two
unrelated topics, so semantic search retrieves chunks that are mediocre
matches for *both* halves instead of good matches for either. Decomposing
first means each sub-question gets its own targeted retrieval pass, and the
synthesis step re-combines the results — trading one retrieval call for
several more precise ones.

## Why two chunking strategies?

- **`fixed`** splits text into equal-size windows. It's simple and
  strategy-agnostic, but can cut a legal clause in half or merge unrelated
  clauses into one chunk, which hurts both retrieval precision and citation
  accuracy.
- **`structured`** splits on the documents' own boundaries (section
  headings, numbered/lettered clauses), so a retrieved chunk is always one
  complete, citable unit. The tradeoff is that it's corpus-specific — it
  assumes the legal-document structure these sample files have, whereas
  `fixed` works on any text.

Comparing the two strategies against the same questions is the point of
keeping them in separate collections (`documents_fixed` /
`documents_structured`) rather than picking one.

All commands below assume you're running from the **repo root** (not this
directory), so that `./data` and `./chroma_db` resolve correctly.

## Ingest documents

Put `.txt` files in a directory (default `./data`), then run:

```bash
python projects/v1-agentic-rag/ingest.py ./data
```

This chunks each file and upserts it into a persistent Chroma collection at
`./chroma_db` (using Chroma's built-in local embedding model — no embedding
API key required).

Two chunking strategies are available via `--chunking`:

- `fixed` (default) — baseline fixed-width chunking (`core/chunking.py`)
- `structured` — section/clause-aware chunking (`core/structured_chunking.py`)

Each strategy writes to its own Chroma collection by default
(`documents_fixed` / `documents_structured`), so re-ingesting the same docs
with a different strategy never overwrites or mixes chunks from the other:

```bash
python projects/v1-agentic-rag/ingest.py ./data --chunking fixed
python projects/v1-agentic-rag/ingest.py ./data --chunking structured
```

Pass `--collection` to override the default name for either strategy.

## Ask a question

```bash
python projects/v1-agentic-rag/rag_agent.py "your complex, multi-part question"
```

Queries `documents_fixed` by default. To query the structured-chunking
collection instead:

```bash
python projects/v1-agentic-rag/rag_agent.py "your question" --collection documents_structured
```

Or run without an argument to be prompted interactively. The script prints
the decomposed sub-questions, then the final synthesized answer.

### Worked example

```
$ python projects/v1-agentic-rag/rag_agent.py \
    "Can OpenAI share my data with third parties, and can I delete my account?"

Decomposing query...
  1. Under what circumstances does OpenAI share user data with third parties
     (what types of third parties, purposes, and legal bases)?
  2. How can I delete my OpenAI account and what happens to my data after I
     request deletion (steps, timeframe, and retention/backup policy)?
Retrieving context from Chroma...
Synthesizing answer...

Short answer
- Yes — OpenAI may share data with third parties in certain circumstances
  (see details below). [Source: 04_data-processing-addendum.txt, chunk 12; ...]
- For Customers under a DPA, OpenAI commits to direct subprocessors to
  delete Customer Data within 30 days of DPA termination. The excerpts do
  not contain step-by-step consumer self-service deletion instructions.
  [Source: 01_terms-of-use.txt, chunk 12; 04_data-processing-addendum.txt, chunk 26]
...
```

Two things worth noticing in this output: (1) the original question became
two independent sub-questions before any retrieval happened, and (2) every
claim in the answer is tied to a specific source file and chunk — that
traceability is what `metadata` carries through `retrieve()` into
`synthesize()`.

## Retrieval

Retrieval is pure semantic (dense-vector) similarity via Chroma's default
local embedding model — no lexical/keyword matching or re-ranking stage.

## Files

- `ingest.py` — CLI: chunks and loads `.txt` files into Chroma
- `rag_agent.py` — CLI: decompose → retrieve → synthesize pipeline
